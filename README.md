# TGW Migrator

**Description**
The TGW Migrator is a tool which provides a relatively seamless migration path from transit VPC solutions to AWS Transit Gateway. It can also be used to quickly attach and enable routing between VPCs through a common AWS Transit Gateway even if they are not part of a transit VPC.
